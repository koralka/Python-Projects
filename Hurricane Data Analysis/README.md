# Hurricane Analysis Project
This project focuses on analysing data about hurricanes to extract meaningful insights. It was developed as part of Codecademy's Python learning path, offering learners an opportunity to practice data manipulation, conditionals, loops, and more.
## Project Overview
The **Hurricane Analysis Project** involves working with a dataset containing information about historical hurricanes. The primary goal is to implement functions that:
- Organise and structure hurricane data.
- Perform calculations to determine metrics such as the deadliest hurricane and total damage.
- Convert and standardise data for easier analysis.
## Features
Key functionalities of this project include:
- Categorising Hurricanes by Year: Group hurricanes into a dictionary based on the year they occurred.
- Identifying the Deadliest Hurricane: Find the hurricane with the highest number of deaths.
- Damage Conversion: Standardise damage values into numeric formats for easier comparison (e.g., millions to integers).
- Categorising Hurricanes by Damage: Classify hurricanes based on the extent of their damage.
## Filtes
- **Hurricane Analysis Project.ipynb** - the notebook where the analysis and the functions were implemented
- **Hurricane Analysis_Solution.ipynb** - a solution notebook provided by Codecademy for reference and comparison.
## Skills Practiced:
- Data structures: Working with dictionaries and lists.
- Conditionals and loops.
- Data standardisation and cleaning.
- Basic algorithm implementation.
